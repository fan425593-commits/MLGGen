Assets folder and sample filenames

Place the following (or your own equivalents) into the assets/ folder:

- airhorn.mp3            (short loud "airhorn" sound)
- doritos.png            (PNG overlay)
- mtndew.mp3             (music bed or short sound)
- lensflare.png          (overlay)
- hitmarker.mp3          (optional sound effect)
- sample_sfx/            (optional subfolder for many short sfx)

You can rename assets in the config or pass explicit asset paths to the CLI/GUI.
